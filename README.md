# Machine-learning,Python-Code
Hello everyone in this group you can find my project which I worked with Python for Machine Learning.
If you want to install libraries for machine learning, you need to Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, sciket-learning, Pytorch, seaborn and Tensorflow.
For beginners only Numpy Pandas Matplotlib and scikit-learn are good.
